<h2>Welcome to AIDAR Lab</h2>
<p align="center">Artificial Intelligence and Data Analytics Research (AIDAR) Laboratory is a part of Department of Electrical Engineering at Indian Institute of
   Technology Kanpur, India and is led by Prof. Nishchal K. Verma. The research at AIDAR Lab mainly focuses on Artificial Intelligence, Deep Learning, Machine Learning,
    Computer Vision, Cyber Physical Systems, and Cognitive Science.
The primary goal of the lab is to develop technologies and tools which address the various complex and challenging problems affecting the real-world especially where traditional
 approaches are not effective.
In parallel to theoretical research, new applications like Future Image Frame Generator using smart computing devices i.e. Smartphone, palmtop, Vision based Inventory Management System,
Vision based Automated Guided Vehicle, Deep Learning Strategies in BioInformatics, Image Classification and Condition Based Monitoring are being developed. Apart from this, Transducers and
Instrumentation Virtual Laboratory has been setup for UG students for conducting experiments online and offline to better understand the working of various transducers and related instruments.</p>
