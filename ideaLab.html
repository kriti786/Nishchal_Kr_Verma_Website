<h2>Welcome to IDEA Lab</h2>
<p align="center">Intelligent Data Engineering and Automation (IDEA) Laboratory is a part of Department of Electrical Engineering at Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur, India and is led by Prof. Nishchal K. Verma.
   Research at IDEA Lab mainly focuses on Computational Intelligence, Fuzzy Systems Modelling & Control, Condition Based Monitoring of UAVs, UGVs and Rotating Machines, Industrial Automation, Big Data Analysis,
   Deep Learning of Neural and Fuzzy Networks, Machine Learning Algorithms, Computer Vision and Image Processing, Brain Computer/ Machine Interface, Intelligent Informatics, Soft-Computing in Modelling and Control,
    Internet of Things/ Cyber Physical Systems, Cognitive Science and Intelligent Fault Diagnosis Systems, and Prognosis and Health Management.
The primary goal of the lab is to develop technologies and tools which address the various complex and challenging problems affecting the real-world especially where traditional approaches are not effective.
On the theoretical front, the emphasis is on finding algorithms for the central tasks in data mining and computer vision, such as dimensionality reduction, clustering and classification algorithms.

In parallel to theoretical research, new applications like Smartphone based Intelligent Condition Based Monitoring System, Sensitive Position Finder, Future Image Frame Generator using smart computing devices
 i.e. Smartphone, palmtop, Vision based Inventory Management System, Automated Guided Vehicle, Deep Learning Strategies in BioInformatics, Image Classification and Condition Based Monitoring are being developed.
 This lab also facilitates the BCI lab where we have the emotiv epoc, a 14-channel high-resolution wireless EEG system for conducting various experiments on real time EEG signals. Apart from this, Transducers and
 Instrumentation Virtual Laboratory has been setup for UG students for conducting experiments online and offline to better understand the working of various transducers and related instruments.
